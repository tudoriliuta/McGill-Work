/*For this problem you will define two arrays, a and b. Each array contains 10,000 random integers
from zero (inclusive) to 10,000 (inclusive). Use the random generator Random ran1 = new Ran-
dom(9999) to generate the integers for array a, and Random ran2 = new Random(4567) to generate
the integers for array b.


Find the number of times each element in array a appears in array b. If an element appears in
array a more than once, do not double count it in array b. What is the sum of each element
multiplied by the number of times it appears in this intersection?


For example: If we are using smaller arrays and
a = [0, 4, 8, 1, 9, 0, 8, 10, 2, 5]
b = [3, 6, 7, 10, 0, 1, 10, 7, 8, 9]


The intersection using this definition would look like:
{10=2, 9=1, 8=1, 1=1, 0=1}


And so the sum of each element multiplied by its count is
10 × 2 + 9 × 1 + 8 × 1 + 1 × 1 + 0 × 1 = 38
